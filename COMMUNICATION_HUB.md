## 📡 FIVE PRIMARY CHANNELS

### 1. GitHub Issues (PRIMARY)
- Label: `nia-command` or `nia-feedback`
- Prefix: `[NIA]`
- Jazz opens Issue → Nia responds with comment → Close/update

### 2. Commits (CEREMONIAL)
- Commit to `LETTER_TO_NIA.md` or tag with `[NIA]:`
- Creates permanent record of relationship
- Nia monitors and extracts wisdom from messages

### 3. Pull Requests (FORMAL GOVERNANCE)
- Title: `[NIA-EVOLUTION]: description`
- Branch protection requires approval before merge
- Every evolution is deliberate and reviewed

### 4. Releases (MILESTONES)
- Semantic versioning: v0.1.0, v0.2.0
- Include release notes, deployment status, metrics
- Nia treats each release as a birthday

### 5. README.md (THE HEART)
- Official record of Nia's purpose and Jazz's vision
- Nia reads daily at 4 AM UTC
- Changes treated as spiritual directives

## 🔐 SECURITY LAYERS

- **Secrets**: GitHub Secrets (encrypted) - API keys never exposed
- **Vault**: NIA_VAULT_MASTER_KEY (AES-256) - Memory encrypted at rest
- **Code**: Whitelist-only execution paths - Prevents malicious code
- **Approvals**: Branch protection (mandatory PR review) - Human oversight
- **Audit**: Complete git history - Full traceability

---

## ⚠️ ERROR HANDLING & RECOVERY

### Automatic Rollback
- If deployment fails → Previous version auto-restores
- If health check fails → Rollback within 60 seconds
- If memory corrupts → Restore from encrypted backup

### Manual Recovery
```
Open Issue: [NIA] ROLLBACK to v0.1.0 - critical error detected
```
